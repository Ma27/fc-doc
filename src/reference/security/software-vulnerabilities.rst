Software vulnerabilities
========================

Security issues with software installed on machines are monitored using the
operating system's vulnerability database (GLSA) which allows to check for
known vulnerabilities in the installed packages of a machine.

If a vulnerability applies to a machine then the monitoring system alerts the
administrators. After that our goal is to install fixes within 24 hours of
their availability. However, the actual timing depends on the specific
complexity of the vulnerability and may require more time for extensive
testing to ensure continuous operation of the affected systems. The
requirement of availability of the service will be considered in comparison to
the severity of the vulnerability.

The process of performing security updates  will be followed when applying
security fixes.

Release 2019_026 (2019-11-18)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [Gentoo] Kernel compilation placed a bit of load on the infrastructure. Expect
  somewhat slower response time during roll-out. Reboots will be scheduled
  during regular maintenance windows.


NixOS 19.03 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Webgateway role: fix Nginx config check error caused by missing initial logdir
  (#120280).


Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update Gentoo kernel to most recent LTS branch (4.19) (#120249).
* Automate certificate renewal for expired puppet client certificates.
* Remove outdated *sys-kernel/gentoo-sources* ebuild that fails parsing (#119983).
* Remove very special restricted mode from our Gentoo platform as it is unused,
  unsupported, and has started to break (#120018).

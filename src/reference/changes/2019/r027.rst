.. XXX update on release :Publish Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Release 2019_027 (unreleased)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^


NixOS 15.09 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update grub to 2.04 for improved support of the modern XFS on-disk format and thus reducing reboot times.
* Remove vulnix as it is broken and outdated on 15.09. To improve overall security, we focus on the current 19.03 platform. 
  We still provide critical security fixes but 15.09 VMs should be migrated to 19.03 for best security monitoring and updates.

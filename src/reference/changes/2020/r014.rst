Release 2020_014 (2020-05-25)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [Gentoo] sshd will be restarted.


NixOS 19.03 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Generate all locales instead of just en_US.utf8 (#126182).
* Pick up latest upstream security fixes for 19.03.
  Affected packages: openssl, pyopenssl, aspell, fribidi.
* Retry system update on failure if update in maintenance is enabled.
  This is expected to avoid failed maintenance jobs (#126172).


Gentoo platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update *keepalived* to 2.0.20 to allow setting `preferred_lft`. Work around
  for active routers to be able to speak IPv6 to the world in specific data
  center situations (#120274).
* Security updates for: sudo, openssh, openssl, git, tar, curl (#123291).
* Enable driver support for Mellanox Gen 5 cards to supplement our routers with
  another vendor (#126290).
* Remove GLSA monitoring on Gentoo as the update process is End Of Life and now
  only performed with a schedule-based review of existing high priority GLSAs
  but not per system (#126186).

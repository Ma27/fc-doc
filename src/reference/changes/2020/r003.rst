Impact
^^^^^^

NixOS 15.09 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* nothing yet


NixOS 19.03 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Don't trigger logrotate on fc-manage runs. This avoids maintenance errors that 
  are not really related to it. Also, make nginx log rotation more robust (#119218).
* Provide the magic wormhole utility as a potential replacement for our NFS box
  feature by default. No customization or deeper integration has happened yet,
  but this automates installation of the CLI utility and stops customers from
  having to install it manually all the time.
* Grant journal access to wheel, sudo-srv, admins and service groups (#106521).


Gentoo platform

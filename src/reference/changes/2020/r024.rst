Release 2020_024 (2020-08-10)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [NixOS 19.03] MySQL and Tideways daemons will be restarted.


NixOS 19.03 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* MySQL root password can now be set by service users before MySQL starts
  by changing the password file. That is helpful for automated deployments (#126845).
* Update tideways to 1.6.6 so it doesn't crash in test suite now and can be
  run as a separate user (instead of nobody) (#126611).
* Ensure we build sufficient sensu packages centrally on our Hydra to avoid
  building them on every machine locally (#127681).

Release 2016_011 (2016-04-04)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* We will perform individually scheduled offline maintenance for
  VMs to place them into the newly created Ceph RBD pools.
* All Java applications need a restart to run with the updated JDK.
* Many services (e.g PostgreSQL) will be restarted, due to the updated glib.


Packages
^^^^^^^^

* fc-qemu: update to 0.7.18
* fc-agent: update to 1.9.1
* IcedTea (JDK): update to 7.2.6.4 for `GLSA 201603-14
  <https://glsa.gentoo.org/glsa/201603-14>`_. Remove IcedTea 6 as it is not
  supported upstream anymore (#20566).
* gcc: update to 4.9.3 as a dependency for JDK (#20566).
* glib: update to 2.44.1 as a dependency for JDK (#20566).
* mercurial: update to 3.6.3 (#20556)
* mod_security: update to post-2.9.1 pre-release branch to include a bugfix
  for correctly handling file uploads. (#19990)

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Move all VMs into centralized Ceph pools to optimize the number of
  placement groups. This will improve overall Ceph performance, specifically
  latency and reduce impact during cluster recovery operations. (#20692)
* Limit PostgreSQL maximum shared memory to 1.400 MB for Gentoo. The Linux
  Kernel 4.1.16 will not allow more. (#20732)


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Improve emergency alerting for out-of-disk conditions on KVM hosts. (#20387)
* Improve disk check (#14222).

Release 2015_001 (2015-01-12)
-----------------------------

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Remove ahbl.org DNS blacklists as those were discontinued.

* Flush all IPv6 neighbour caches every 15 minutes to work around a deficiency
  in our IPv6 router failover setup. This avoids an edge case where some nodes
  do not update their IPv6 routes properly and need manual intervention.

* Fix bug where awstats was not able to handle web servers with wildcard names
  correctly (#13860).

Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix information leak in Nagios' configuration view (#14157).


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Appoint new data protection officer, see :ref:`data-protection` (#13907).

Release 2015_042 (2015-09-15)
-----------------------------

Packages
^^^^^^^^

* Re-enable xlhtml which got marked unstable in the last OS update.
* Introduce keepalived for high availability routers
  as a more mature, well-maintained, faster and more stable replacement for ucarp.
* Always provide a telnet client.
* Ensure PHP gets the right libpjeg, countering a broken dependency
  in Gentoo.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Re-enable disk shrinking now that we're on compatible kernels everywhere.
  (#14076)
* Set number of nginx workers to the VMs CPU count to get SSL-heavy workloads
  processed faster (#17171).
* Activate event handling for consistent VM snapshots (clean filesystems)
  with backy.
* Improve scalability of our Puppet infrastructure (#17158).
* Improve our physical hardware installer to be more robust and use a consistent set of kernel/modules/firmware from the original Gentoo installer CDs.

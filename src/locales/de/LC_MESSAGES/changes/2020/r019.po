"Revert our atomic firewall to the fine-grained reload/reconfiguration "
"mechanism in baseline NixOS. This helps compatibility with dynamic rule "
"systems like Docker, Kubernetes, etc. We also now filter custom rules in "
"/etc/local/firewall to only interact with custom chains and prohibit "
"interaction with the default chains. Existing configurations may become "
"invalid but will not silently break as NixOS catches those errors without"
" breaking the running configuration. We'll clean up customer "
"installations that are affected by this (#124117)."

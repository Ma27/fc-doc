"Nginx: add option `services.nginx.masterUser` to be able to change the "
"user for the Nginx master process. Nothing changes if you are using the "
"platform `webgateway` / `nginx` roles or the "
"`flyingcircus.services.nginx` service. They still use `root` and run the "
"worker processes as `nginx`. Plain `services.nginx` now uses `nginx` for "
"both by default like the upstream NixOS module. Note that changing this "
"setting is experimental when using our platform roles/service and "
"problems may occur, especially if Nginx has already been running on the "
"system (#PL-130015)."

"Nginx: custom Flying Circus options can be fully configured via Nix code "
"now. `flyingcircus.services.nginx.virtualHosts.<domain>` supports the "
"same options as JSON config for easy porting of JSON to Nix. The options "
"`services.nginx.virtualHosts.<domain>.listenAddress` and `listenAddress6`"

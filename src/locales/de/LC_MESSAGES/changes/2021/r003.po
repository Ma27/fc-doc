"Logging: ship structured log data from the journal to loghost/graylog "
"instead of using the limited Syslog format. It provides more metadata "
"about log events and preserves multiline messages from the journal. "

"HAProxy isn't forwarded to Graylog anymore and only logs to "
":file:`/var/log/haproxy.log`. :file:`/var/log/messages` is no longer "
"used. (#PL-128336)."

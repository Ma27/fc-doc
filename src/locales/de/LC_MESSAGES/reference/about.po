msgid ""
"The Flying Circus is a managed, agile platform for hosting Python web "
"applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:6
msgid ""
"We provide virtual Linux machines enabling developers to use any software"
" they like in an environment they know but without having to administer "
"an operating system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:10
msgid ""
"We provide widely-used open-source web application components like nginx,"
" haproxy, varnish, PostgreSQL, and more. All of them are managed with a "
"production-proven configuration but you also have the freedom to adjust "
"their configuration to your needs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:15
msgid ""
"All of the Flying Circus is managed: we take care of all the operational "
"issues like monitoring, installing updates and patches, backup, user "
"management, etc. so that you can focus on building your application and "
"take care of your customers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:20
msgid ""
"Also, we love every single VM and make sure it is healthy and is "
"performing well at any time."

msgid "Our approach"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:25
msgid ""
"Our approach to the Flying Circus is based on a set of principles, "
"methods, and practices sometimes referred to as "
"[DevOps](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/DevOps)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:28
msgid "To us, the most important aspects are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:30
msgid "Automation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:32
msgid ""
"We automate almost everything: from provisioning physical or virtual "
"machines, to installing packages together with their monitoring "
"configuration, to complete operating system updates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:36
msgid ""
"This speeds up the initial configuration and helps keeping your "
"configuration up-to-date even if your application has been running for "
"months or years."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:40
msgid ""
"It also ensures that you profit from new features and bug fixes without "
"having to buy new stuff or hiring us to configure it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:43
msgid ""
"However, if you need something quick, we'll make sure that the automation"
" does not get in your way and will figure something out for you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:46
msgid "Virtualisation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:48
msgid ""
"Hardware is expensive, dirty, unreliable, and inflexible. That is why we "
"provide you with virtual machines instead: many things become cheap, "
"clean, reliable and flexible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:52
msgid ""
"We take care of all the complicated things related to hardware and in "
"return you get all the good things from virtualised environments:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:55
msgid ""
"allocating the resources (CPU power, disk, memory) that you actually need"
" and only paying for what you use"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:57
msgid ""
"adjusting the allocated resources in a timely manner usually in a few "
"minutes or hours"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:59
msgid ""
"isolating services in  separate machines increases reliability, "
"cleanliness, and flexibility"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:61
msgid ""
"hardware failures become irrelevant, hardware improvements become "
"available without reinstalling the system"
msgstr ""

msgid "Continuous improvements"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:66
msgid ""
"When operating a web application today, chances are that you are already "
"continuously improving it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:69
msgid ""
"However, if a server is set up once it will get old and the time will "
"come when your application can not evolve any longer in that crufty, old "
"setup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:72
msgid ""
"We continuously keep both your virtual machines and our configurations up"
" to date and introduce new features and technology so that your "
"application will always find a modern, secure environment to work in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:76
msgid ""
"In our heavily automated environment we express almost all of our "
"infrastructure as programming code and thus can leverage similar tools "
"that you know from developing your application:"
msgstr ""

"Also, we'd like to hear from you about what you are missing or what you "

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:91
msgid "Something that works today may not work tomorrow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:93
msgid ""
"As any application today consists of many parts working together "
"seamlessly nobody can personally keep track of the status of the overall "
"system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:97
msgid ""
"We therefore monitor many parameters of all systems and applications and "
"keep you informed of their current status as well as giving you accesss "
"to the historic data about their availability and their performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/reference/about.md:101
msgid ""
"In addition to the automatically deployed system checks your application "
"can be monitored closely given that you provide the necessary information"
" to us."

"Running your application with a service provider implies that your data "
"(and the data of your customers) is stored at a location that you do not "
"have direct access to."

"Our API is provided as an [XML-RPC](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-"
"RPC) endpoint at the URL <https://api.flyingcircus.io/v1>. We use "
"[Apache's XML-RPC "
"extensions](https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/extensions.html)  to support "
"`null` values and `long` integer types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/guide/api/introduction.md:8
msgid ""
"There are two methods implemented (`query()` and `apply()`) that work on "
"resources like virtual machines, user permissions, projects, maintenance "
"windows, and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/guide/api/introduction.md:18
msgid ""
"The API is designed with idempotence and transactional behaviour in mind "
"to support reliability: re-playing actions will always cause the same "
"result as the first time and you can group together changes that are "
"either applied all at once or not at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/guide/api/introduction.md:23
msgid ""
"Changes applied to resources are stored in our inventory database when "
"calling the API. There is no guarantee that any change is applied to the "
"actual objects on our platform within a given period of time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/guide/api/introduction.md:27
msgid ""
"For example: changing the RAM of a virtual machine will update the record"
" in our database. This in turn causes maintenance to be scheduled for a "
"controlled reboot of the VM depending on the project's maintenance window"
" configuration."

"To interact with the API you need to authenticate within the context of a"

msgid "Authorization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/guide/api/introduction.md:59
msgid ""
"Access to any resource is granted based on the relation of the project "
"the access key belongs to. A key is granted either full access (r/w) to "
"any object within the project or no access at all. This includes all "
"objects of any child projects."

"We expect customers to perform a reasonable number of API requests "
"without enforcing them at the moment. Consider caching data on your side "

"Using this (over hosted options for test environments) has the benefit "

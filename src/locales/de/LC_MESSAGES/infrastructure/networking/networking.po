"The physical network in our public datacenter is implemented with Extreme"
" VDX switches in a leaf-spine architecture with a redundant (n=2) spine. "
"We leverage 1G/10G ports for VM connectivity, 10G ports for storage and "
"redundant 2x40G connectivity in our backbone. The datacenter uplink from "
"our routers uses 10G connectivity."

"**MGM** - Management, purely for administrative purposes. This VLAN "
"connects switch management ports, Remote Access Controllers, and "
"typically provides a separate point of entry so that administrator can "
"use management features even in the case that the routers are completely "
"offline. Not accessible from the outside world, private IPv4 address "
"space. DNS example: *switch.mgm.rzob.gocept.net*."

"**FE** - Frontend, for providing actual service traffic. This VLAN "
"connects to machines that provide customers' applications to the public. "
"This network is switched to the virtual machines and leverages completely"
" public traffic. The DC firewalls to not filter this. Customer "
"applications are free to use any ports they like but must be careful "
"opening them. VMs can filter this network locally. All VMs receive a NIC "
"on this VLAN but not necessarily IPv4 addresses if they do not provide "
"public traffic. DNS example: *vm00.fe.rzob.gocept.net*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../src/infrastructure/networking/networking.md:43
msgid ""
"**SRV** - Server to server communication. Used for customer application "
"components to talk to each other, e.g. database traffic and for "
"management purposes on the application level. This network is firewalled "
"from the DC firewalls and allows only HTTP/S and SSH traffic. "
"Additionally VMs can filter this traffic locally and only allow free "
"traffic by default from VMs belonging to the same project. All VMs have "
"this NIC used and addresses allocated. DNS example: "
"*vm00.srv.rzob.fcio.net* or simply *vm00.fcio.net*."

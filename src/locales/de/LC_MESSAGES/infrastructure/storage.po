"VM storage is provided by a Ceph cluster. Each block device visible in "
"VMs (e.g., :file:`/dev/vda` or :file:`/dev/sda`) reflects an underlying "

"When *growing* a virtual disk, we enlarge the underlying RBD volume, "
"adapt the partition table and resize the main filesystem. This procedure "
"is fully transpart and can be performed without downtime."

"*Shrinking* a virtual disk is not directly supported. On customer "
"request, we install a filesystem quota to ensure that no more space is "
"used than booked. On newer NixOS VMs with XFS filesystems, tools like "
":command:`df` report that reduced size correctly. Older Gentoo-based VMs "
"with ext4 filesystems are not so smart; :command:`df` still reports the "
"old size even when a quota is installed.  Nonetheless, we will monitor "
"disk usage on basis of the reduced disk size."

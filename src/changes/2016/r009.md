# Release 2016_009 (2016-03-09)

## Impact

- All Cluster daemons will be restarted, slowly and carefully, to activate
  the new release and configuration. We do not expect noticable impact.

## Packages

- Update Ceph: 0.94.5 -> 0.94.6
- Fix box hashes (#20488)

## Configuration

- We are ignoring the security update for ipython
  [GLSA 201512-02](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201512-02) as
  we are not affected by the issue.
- Adjust Ceph options to make maintenance activities like scrubbing and
  snapshot trimming less impactful.
- Switch Ceph to "jemalloc" allocator for improved latency.

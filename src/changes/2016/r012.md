Release 2016_012 (2016-04-11)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* The OpenSSL upgrade causes restarts of all services that offer encryption.


Packages
^^^^^^^^

* OpenSSL: update to 1.0.2g for `GLSA 201603-15
  <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201603-15>`_ (#20792).


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Change `box` directories from direct mountpoints to symbolic links
  and autofs. This improves VM startup reliability (#19668).
* Improve reliability of the VM bootstrap process.


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Remove temperature monitoring from ProCurve switches: not all of them
  support it and the data is not useful enough to make the monitoring
  configuration more complicated. (#18515)

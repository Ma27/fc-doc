# Release 2016_014 (2016-05-03)

## Impact

- NixOS VMs will be rebooted to enable filesystem quotas (#14222).

## Packages

- Security update for libksba [GLSA 201604-04](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201604-04) (#21390).
- Upgrade fc.qemu to 0.7.20.

## Configuration

- Quota-based disk shrink for NixOS VMs (#14222).
- Scheduled maintenance for NixOS VMs (#20505).
- Ensure customer-reserved local ports (#21298).

## Monitoring

- Improve KVM health check (#21349).
- Add monitoring for NixOS MySQL servers (#21337).

## Documentation

- We ensure that ports 61000-61999 will always be available
  for your applications. If you want to be absolutely sure that
  you can assign a static port to your application, use this range.
  We will keep typical ports (like 8080) free from managed components
  as long as it makes sense, but typically we use a component's default
  port.

# Release 2016_013 (2016-04-25)

## Configuration

- Reduce amount of data logged to the VM serial console. We found high
  amounts of output to interfere substantially with smooth operations.
  We're now only logging emergency and critical as well as all kernel
  messages, instead of everything that passes through rsyslog (#20415, #21303).

## Documentation

- Remove "Olark" chat box from web pages. They have not been used that much.
- Clarify Apache restart options in {ref}`apache` role docmentation.

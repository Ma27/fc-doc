# Release 2014_006 (2014-02-05)

## Configuration

- Improve backup performance to keep backup jobs in the announced time window
  (midnight - 6am) (RT 93307).
- Reduce Ceph backfill rate in case of OSDs joining/leaving the storage cluster.
  Ceph backfills should have minimal impact of production storage performance
  now.
- Reduce frequency of backup server configuration reloads to prevent aborted
  backup jobs (#13112).

## Monitoring

- Enhanced Ceph performance monitoring. This helps admins to trouble shoot
  storage related probleems more quickly (#12589).

# Release 2014_002 (2014-01-16)

## Packages

- Declined security update for [GLSA 201309-05 / pip](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201309-05.xml) (#13119).
  In the Flying Circus, pip cannot be invoked to install system packages.
- Declined security update for [GLSA 201401-07 / libxslt](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201401-07.xml) yet (#13120).
  This update depends on libxml2 >= 2.9. An update of libxml2 is not feasible
  yet. Thus, libxslt is blocked as well. Because of the low security impact of
  the libxslt bugs in our environment, we decide to defer the libxslt update as
  well.

## Configuration

- Add secondary resolvers so that we have redundant resolvers *per location*.
  Move the failed DNS server to another machine (RT 92882).

## Monitoring

- The 'haproxy port' check now parses {file}`/etc/haproxy.cfg` for the port
  haproxy is supposed to listen on.

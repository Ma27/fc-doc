# Release 2014_037 (2014-07-30)

## Packages

- Security update for [GLSA 201407-05 / openssl](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201407-05.xml) (#13549).
  Restarts of PostgreSQL may be necessary due to changed link dependencies.

## Configuration

- Add root SSH key for orchestration support through the "directory".
- Execute tighter control on key storage parameters like number of Ceph PGs per
  pool to keep performance variations in bounds (#13491).
- Make invocation of `perl-cleaner` and `python-cleaner` independent of
  update-system's specific *todo list* to better support convergence.
- Improve ceph restart: use ceph-provided restart command and increase
  post start wait period to lower the noise level in cluster.

## Monitoring

- Fine-tune portage integrity check (RT 96400).

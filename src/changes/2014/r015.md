## Configuration

- Improve our KVM configuration script to avoid accidental VM shutdown.

  user deletion - data will be removed by regular 24h cycle of the box anyway.
  (#13278)
- Make the NFS box client configuration code more robust towards NFS mounting
  issues: try remounting when discovering that \$HOME/box is a stale NFS handle.
- Tighten the safety belt for Ceph pool removal: disable the low-level method
  completely and raise a warning  if someone starts using it again. (#13278)
- Remove superfluous unscheduled fsck during online disk size increase. (#13278)
- Improve backup/restore machinery to make parallel restores easier to operate.

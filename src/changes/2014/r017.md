# Release 2014_017 (2014-03-31)

## Configuration

- Refactor management codebase to separate data from code (#11166).
- Remove dynamic variable lookups from Puppet manifests to prepare Puppet update
  (#10544).
- Make varnishd listen on both loopback and *SRV* (backend) networks by default
  (#13235).
- Close idle login shells after 12h to prevent orphan sessions piling up
  (#13321).

## Monitoring

- Decrease sensitivity of swap rate checks since they make a lot of noise.

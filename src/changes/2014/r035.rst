Release 2014_035 (2014-07-12)
-----------------------------


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add serial console settings for SuperMicro X9SRL-F boards.
* Fix to clean out manual egg installations in
  :file:`/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages` and keep them out in the future, too.
* Switch MySQL to the 'MIXED' binlog format by default as this provides
  the best tradeoff between functionality and performance (RT96330).
* Store varnish shared memory on tmpfs to avoid crashes if disk IO is
  blocking unexpectedly.


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Fine-tune portage integrity check (RT 96375).

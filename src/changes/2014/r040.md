# Release 2014_040 (2014-08-18)

## Packages

- Reflect source URL changes on bitbucket in local ebuilds (#13577).
- Ignore [GLSA 201408-02 / freetype](http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201408-02.xml) (#13567) as
  the update does not fit properly and the attack vector is neglible
  in our platform.

## Configuration

- Prepare partitioning for the upcoming installation of GRUB2 (#13421).
- Automatically create a support ticket when restoring a VM from backup
  so that we reliably notify customers about it. (#12348)

## Monitoring

- Improve physical disk health monitoring once again for better accuracy in
  detecting soon-to-be-failing disks.

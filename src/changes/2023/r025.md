# Release 2023_025 (unreleased)

## Impact

- nothing yet

## NixOS 23.05 platform

- nginx: fix initial letsencrypt (acme) validation for newly added vhosts. (PL-131657).
- *awscli*, *firefox*: track version changes in our release change logs. They
   are also built by our Hydra (cache) now to make sure that machines don't
   have to compile these if the upstream NixOS cache doesn't have them, yet.
   We noticed this when rolling out the last release which caused a mass
   rebuild of packages which was due to the glibc security patch (PL-131831).

# Release 2023_003 (2023-02-20)

## NixOS 22.05 platform

- fc-agent: add monthly log rotation for main log file (PL-131173).
- nginx: fix allow/deny rule checking for IPv6 + keep-alive and update
  nginxMainline to 1.23.3 (platform default is still stable 1.22). Our IP
  anonymization patch caused an issue where subsequent requests in a
  keep-alive connection were matched against the anonymized address instead of
  the real one (PL-131209).

## NixOS 21.05 platform

# Release 2023_029 (2023-11-13)

## Impact

- \[NixOS 23.05\] VMs will reboot after the update to activate the changed kernel.

## NixOS 23.05 platform

- Move back to Linux 5.15. We experienced multiple VM crashes and slowdowns
  due to a known but unsolved kernel memory management bug with the 6.1
  kernel branch (PL-131574).
- `fc-maintenance` commands for viewing requests (`show` and `list`) and
  monitoring/telemetry (`check` and `metrics`) can now be used without sudo
  by all users (PL-131813).
- `fc-maintenance show <request ID prefix>` now has improved output and also
  works for archived maintenance requests. Active requests are preferred
  when there are multiple matches for the given request ID prefix (PL-131813).
- Command output generated during execution of an update activity is now
  logged to separate files in `/var/log/fc-agent`, like for `fc-manage`
  calls (PL-131813).
- Unhandled errors in `fc-manage` and `fc-maintenance` are now logged properly
  to the system journal and can be viewed with `journalctl
  SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=fc-agent` (PL-131813).

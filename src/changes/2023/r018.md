# Release 2023_018 (2023-08-01)

## Impact

- \[NixOS 23.05\] Most services will be restarted because of a core dependency change.
   Machines will schedule a reboot to activate the changed kernel.
- \[NixOS 22.11\] PHP-FPM services will be restarted.
   Machines will schedule a reboot to activate the changed kernel.


## NixOS 23.05 platform

- ssh: remove `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256` key exchange algorithm
  because of a bug in openssh which weakens security. The algorithm can be
  added again by setting
  `services.openssh.settings.KexAlgorithms = [ "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256" ];`
  if old clients should require it.
  This also adds the `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512` and `diffie-hellman-group18-sha512`
  kex algorithms (PL-131620).
- agent: improve scheduling of maintenance activities for system updates and
  VM property changes (memory, CPU cores). The main change is that activities
  can be merged/updated now. As a result, the number of reboots is reduced
  and multiple pending updates can be applied faster. Activities can be
  cancelled if they are no longer effective, for example if a memory change
  is requested in error and reset to the previous value some time later.
  Reboots for kernel updates now happen directly after system updates,
  avoiding scheduling another maintenance for the reboot. This also fixes the
  long-standing bug that delayed activities could be executed outside of
  maintenance windows. Activities that are overdue (more than 30min after
  planned time) are postponed for at least 8 hours and scheduled again
  (PL-129777).
- agent: handle special exit codes of maintenance enter commands (defined by
  `flyingcircus.agent.maintenance.enter.*`) correctly. They can now use
  EXIT_POSTPONE (69) or EXIT_TEMPFAIL (75) to stop execution before
  maintenance requests are run, typically when pre-conditions are not met.
  This is currently not used by platform code but will be useful to prevent
  redundant machines from having service interruptions caused by automated
  maintenance at the same time (PL-130625).
- python: re-enable the `crypt` module for obsolete Python version 2.7
  to fix compatibility with legacy applications (PL-131527).
- Enable and configure `fail2ban` to reduce the impact of brute force attacks
  against SSH (PL-131632).

  - asterisk: apply patch for pjsip (CVE-2023-27585)

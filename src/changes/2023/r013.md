# Release 2023_013 (unreleased)

## Impact

- nothing yet

## NixOS 23.05 platform

This is the first production release of the 23.05 platform. The default for
new production VMs is still 22.11 which will be changed in the next weeks.

We rolled out the upgrade to most of the customer **staging** systems on Thursday, 2023-06-01.


- Add `lamp_php82`, which provides PHP version 8.2 for the `lamp` role (PL-131403).
- Remove `gdb` from default system packages because it takes a lot of disk space. Scripts cannot rely on it being in PATH by default anymore.

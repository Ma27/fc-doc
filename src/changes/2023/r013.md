## NixOS 23.05 platform

This is the first production release of the 23.05 platform. The default for
new production VMs is still 22.11 which will be changed in the coming weeks.

We rolled out the upgrade to most of the customer **staging** systems on Thursday, 2023-06-01.

The following changes were added after the staging roll-out last week:

- Add `lamp_php82`, which provides PHP version 8.2 for the `lamp` role (PL-131403).
- Remove `gdb` from default system packages because it takes a lot of disk space. Scripts cannot rely on it being in PATH by default anymore.
- Pull upstream NixOS changes, security fixes and package updates (PL-131551):
  - gitlab: 15.11.6 -> 16.0.2
  - imagemagick: 7.1.1-10 -> 7.1.1-11
  - linux: 6.1.30 -> 6.1.31
  - matrix-synapse: 1.84.0 -> 1.85.1
  - openssl_1_1: 1.1.1t -> 1.1.1u (CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-0466, CVE-2023-0465, CVE-2023-0464)
- k3s: update the `kubernetes-make-kubeconfig` script included with the
  `k3s-server` role to function correctly with recent Kubernetes versions
  (PL-131534).

## NixOS 22.11 platform

- Gitlab: 15.11.6 -> 15.11.8 (PL-131536).

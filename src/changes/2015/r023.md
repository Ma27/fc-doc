# Release 2015_023 (2015-05-06)

## Packages

- Upgrade app-text/ghostscript to 9.14 (#15556).

## Configuration

- Increase nginx bucket size. Needs to happen in global config due to early
  usage of our platform maps (#15516).
- Do not inherit the locale environment from SSH connections. This can end
  up with very confusing situations including breaking data consistency.
- Roll out Consul base installation (#14919).

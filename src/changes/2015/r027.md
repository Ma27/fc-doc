# Release 2015_027 (2015-05-29)

## Configuration

- Improve Postfix/Dovecot integration to reduce turn-around times to set up
  typical mail server configurations (#15759). May cause PostgreSQL restarts due
  to changed link level dependencies.
- Improve mail server bounce behaviour: don't send backscatter for non-existent
  Dovecot mailboxes in certain configurations (#15771).
- Create standard mailboxes (Drafts, Trash, Sent) by default (#15813).
- Remove globally configured hg hostfingerprint as they tend to change from time
  to time.

## Documentation

- Add DNS configuration tips to {ref}`mailserver`.
- Mention integration points in {ref}`dovecot`.
- Add hints about how to connect to MySQL using the MySQL root user.

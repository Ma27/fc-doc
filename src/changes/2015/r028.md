-----------------------------

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reboot all VMs to activate Qemu 2.2 which is not affected by the VENOM
  vulnerability (#15748).
* Allow selected SSH algorithms for key exchange (diffie-hellman-group14-sha1)
  and MAC (hmac-sha1) which are helpful for compatibility with older clients
  and are reasonably safe for now. (#15940, #15913, #15871)
* Mails passed through mailing list servers are seen by amavis/spamassassin only
  once now.
* Create auxiliary mailboxes (Trash, Sent, Drafts) automatically on IMAP servers
  (#15813).

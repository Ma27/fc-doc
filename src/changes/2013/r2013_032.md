## Configuration

- Port VM bootstrap process to new code base, making it less error-prone

- Review both VM and host kernel configuration in the light of recent networking
  problems (#9699).
- Fix bug that led to kernel compile failures on freshly bootstrapped VMs (RT
  91435).
- Mailman: relax permissions of {file}`/etc/mailman/site_password` so that
  service users can read it (#12922).

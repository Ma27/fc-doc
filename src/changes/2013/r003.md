Release 2013-03-14
------------------

Packages
^^^^^^^^

* Add various XML extensions to the default PHP install.


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add safeguard against rare KVM host crashes due to failed processor MSR
  read/writes (#12195).
* Improve internal NTP server hierarchy to provide more stable system clocks on
  VMs (#10580, #11540).
* Disallow memory overcommit for increased safety. This may affect Redis
  instances with very large allocations.
* Fix bug where Apache's PHP configuration tends to disappear spontaneously
  after package upgrades.
* Drop discontinued NJABL blacklist for spam filtering.
* Adjust RAID controller settings to reduce the chance of data losses after
  machine crashes.


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Improve alerting error handling so that failures in sending out critical
  alerts are escalated right away (#12190).
* Add some flexibility for disk checks so that the 15% limit does not apply
  blindly on very large volumes (#12036).

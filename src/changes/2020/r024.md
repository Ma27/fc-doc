Release 2020_024 (2020-08-10)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [NixOS 19.03] MySQL and Tideways daemons will be restarted.


NixOS 19.03 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* MySQL root password can now be set by service users before MySQL starts
  by changing the password file. That is helpful for automated deployments (#126845).
* Update tideways to 1.6.6 so it doesn't crash in test suite now and can be
  run as a separate user (instead of nobody) (#126611).
* Ensure we build sufficient sensu packages centrally on our Hydra to avoid
  building them on every machine locally (#127681).
* Disable dynamic router_advertisements for IPv6. This caused some frontend
  traffic to be flooded to unrelated VMs. Even though this looks dramatic,
  the affected traffic was public internet traffic so security policies
  require encryption anyway and we've seen encrypted traffic only.
  It did cause superfluous traffic in the network, though (#127887).


NixOS 15.09 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

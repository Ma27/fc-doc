# Release 2019_028 (2019-12-16)

## Impact

- \[Gentoo\] Kernel compilation placed a bit of load on the infrastructure. Expect
  somewhat slower response time during roll-out. Reboots will be scheduled
  during regular maintenance windows.
- \[NixOS 15.09\] Restarts graylog.

## NixOS 15.09 platform

- Update graylog to 2.5.2. Non-GET API requests need a {code}`X-Requested-By` header now: <https://docs.graylog.org/en/3.0/pages/upgrade/graylog-2.5.html>

## Gentoo platform

- Update Gentoo kernel to most recent LTS branch (4.19) (#120249).
- Automate certificate renewal for expired puppet client certificates.
- Remove outdated *sys-kernel/gentoo-sources* ebuild that fails parsing (#119983).
- Remove very special restricted mode from our Gentoo platform as it is unused,
  unsupported, and has started to break (#120018).
- Fix qemu dependency on pixman (#120445).

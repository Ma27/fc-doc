Release 2022_007 (2022-03-02)
-----------------------------

Impact
^^^^^^

* [NixOS 21.05] Apache on LAMP servers will be restarted.


NixOS 21.05 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Work around a suspected Apache/PHP bug regarding dynamic library loading and
  static thread local storage by restarting Apache instead of reloading
  gracefully (PL-130372).
* We now use the black code formatter for our platform Python code.
* Production channel URL for this release: https://hydra.flyingcircus.io/build/138434/download/1/nixexprs.tar.xz


NixOS 21.11 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The 21.11 platform version is now ready for non-production machines.
  We plan to upgrade customer staging VMs from 21.05 to 21.11 in a few
  weeks. Main development will be done on 21.11 from now on.

* Significant breaking changes:

  * HAproxy doesn't support ``log localhost`` anymore, use ``log
    127.0.0.1`` instead.
  * Postgresql 9.6 is end-of-life and has been removed.
  * PHP 5.6 has been EOL for a long time and has been removed.
  * OpenSSH 8.8 default settings break connections to older SSH
    implementations as ssh-rsa host keys and ssh-rsa public keys that
    were signed with SHA-1 are disabled now. They can be re-enabled
    temporarily, if needed.

* iptables now uses *nf_tables* backend. This may lead to problems when
  mixing legacy and new firewall rules.
* Notable package updates:

  * bash now defaults to major version 5.
  * python3 is now python39
  * The varnish package was upgraded from 6.3.x to 7.x.

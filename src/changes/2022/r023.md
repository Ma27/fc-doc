## NixOS 22.05 platform

- webgateway/nginx: set HTTP version to 1.1 (before: 1.0) and timeouts to 60s
  (before: 90s) in `recommendedProxySettings` which are enabled by default.
  The timeout can be changed via the new `services.nginx.proxyTimeout`
  option. The switch to HTTP/1.1 fixes HTTP 413 responses from haproxy when
  Nginx passes a GET requests with a request body. haproxy stopped to accept
  these requests via HTTP/1.0 starting with version 2.5 because they could be
  a security risk. You may want to check plain nginx config in
  `/etc/local/nginx` and change these settings accordingly or remove them to
  use the defaults (#PL-130875).

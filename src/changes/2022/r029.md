# Release 2022_029 (2022-11-21)

## NixOS 22.05 platform

- statshost: deprecate InfluxDB for long-term metrics storage, add options to
  disable InfluxDB or just reading/writing from/to InfluxDB for a phase-out
  period. InfluxDB consumes a lot of RAM, increasing with the number of
  metrics and distinct label values. Prometheus got much better in storing
  data for a longer time period while being far better at memory consumption.
  Prometheus stores data for at least 10 weeks by default, which can
  extended. InfluxDB will be removed completely with the 22.11 platform
  version (#PL-131027).
- fc-postgresql upgrade: use fast cloning mode of pg_upgrade (using XFS
  reflinks) if possible; fix `--no-existing-db-check` option (#PL-131056).
- Production channel URL for this release: https://hydra.flyingcircus.io/build/207216/download/1/nixexprs.tar.xz

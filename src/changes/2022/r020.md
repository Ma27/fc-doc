# Release 2022_020 (2022-08-01)

## Impact

- \[NixOS 21.11\] Elasticsearch nodes will be restarted.
- \[NixOS 21.11\] Jitsi services will be restarted. Conferences will be
  interrupted for a short amount of time.

## NixOS 21.11 platform

- Elasticsearch role improvements (#PL-130608):

  - Make default config safer to prevent accidental cluster splits. Projects
    with multiple Elasticsearch clusters should set the `esNodes` option
    explicitly.
  - Add `initialMasterNodes` option for setting up a cluster which has
    multiple nodes right from the start.
  - Change config defaults to support mixed-version clusters for rolling
    upgrades.
  - Allow service/sudo-srv users to run {command}`elasticsearch-show-config`.
  - Documentation: document our NixOS role options which are the preferred way
    of configuring ES now. The local README
    at {file}`/etc/local/elasticsearch/README.md` now has more dynamically
    generated information about the current node and cluster configuration.

- mailserver: fix changing the user password via Web mailer (Roundcube)
  settings (#PL-130674).

- Jitsi: update packages to latest stable and add watchdog checks to restart
  Jitsi services if they are running but don't work properly. This usually
  happens after a reboot or large system update, making Jitsi conferences
  unavailable until a manual service restart (#PL-130720).

- Redis: document how to change the password (#PL-130686).

- Production channel URL for this release: <https://hydra.flyingcircus.io/build/175951/download/1/nixexprs.tar.xz>

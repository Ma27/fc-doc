# Release 2022_024 (2022-10-10)

NixOS 22.05 is now our recommendation for production systems to get all
security updates and bug fixes provided by NixOS. 21.11 is in maintenance
mode now and will only get critical fixes.

The default for new VMs created via the customer self-service portal
my.flyingcircus.io will be changed to fc-22.05-production with the next
Directory release.

## Impact

- \[NixOS 22.05\] Most services will be restarted due to a core dependency
   change. VMs will schedule a reboot to activate the new kernel version.

## NixOS 22.05 platform

- postgresql: Add {command}`fc-postgresql` with various sub-commands for
  listing data directories for all major versions of PostgreSQL and upgrading
  database clusters (a wrapper around `pg_upgrade`). The command has to be
  run as `postgres` user. We also add options for automated database upgrades
  which are experimental and are meant for internal use only in platform code
  at the moment. (#PL-130197).
- Kubernetes/k3s: fix frontend setup issues that occurred on NixOS 22.05 in
  some networking scenarios. Load-balancing between pods in HAProxy didn't
  work anymore with the old setup because CoreDNS doesn't allow wildcard DNS
  queries anymore. To see how the frontend has to be configured now for
  load-balancing, look at the first networking scenario and the configuration
  reference in the updated
  [Kubernetes/k3s role documentation](https://doc.flyingcircus.io/roles/fc-22.05-staging/kubernetes.html)
  (#PL-130916).
- mailserver: require explicit PostgreSQL version setting if Roundcube web
  mailer is enabled and enable auto-upgrades: changing to a higher major
  PostgreSQL version will automatically upgrade and migrate existing data.
  Note that it will only work by default when no other databases than
  `roundcube` are present in the database cluster. If there are more
  databases, add them to the list of expected databases, like:
  `flyingcircus.postgresql.autoUpgrade.expectedDatabases =[ "anotherdb" ];`
  (#PL-130600).

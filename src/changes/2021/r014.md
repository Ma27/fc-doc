# Release 2021_014 (2021-04-26)

## Impact

- \[NixOS 20.09\] LAMP-based services will be restarted.
- \[NixOS 20.09\] Gitlab will be restarted and be unavailable for some minutes.

## NixOS 20.09 platform

- fc-agent: pre-build updates which are scheduled to run in a maintenance window.
  Stopped/started/restarted/reloaded services are now reported correctly in maintenance mails and the UI.
  This also helps to find build errors earlier (#PL-120275).

- fc-agent: add a notice to the maintenance annoncement when kernel updates will schedule a VM reboot.
  Estimated time for an update is increased to 10 minutes because some services may take minutes to restart (#PL-129798).

- Vagrant: Set mode for service user dirs ({file}`/srv/s-*`) to 755 like on a regular VM (#PL-129791).

- Gitlab: update to 13.8.8 security release (#PL-129795).

- Major improvements of our LAMP role (#PL-129755).

  - We now provide PHP 5.6 (legacy), 7.3 (default) and PHP 7.4 (optional)
  - Tideways integration is automatically enabled/disabled if an API key is provided.
  - We are switching from mpm_event to mpm_prefork as we have seen too many issues with threading and rather prefer a stable service.
  - We added more test coverage to ensure future stability.
  - Added BCMath as a default extension.

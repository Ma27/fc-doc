NixOS 21.05 platform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ACME cert renewal service now tries to run three times per hour on failure
  to avoid hitting the Letsencrypt rate limit (5 failed authorizations per hour) (#PL-130150).
* Install upstream PHP (currently 7.4) globally on machines instead of
  lamp_php73 and drop composer to reduce installation size and speed up updates.
  Machines using the lamp role are not affected, they still install the PHP package
  used by lamp and composer with matching versions globally (#PL-130145).
* MySQL/Percona: increase start and stop timeout to 15 minutes to avoid interrupting recovery or flushing of dirty pages (#PL-130155).
* Pull in upstream NixOS changes that include security fixes and other updates (#PL-130159):

    * ffmpeg: patch CVE-2021-38171 and CVE-2021-38291
    * github-runner: 2.282.0 -> 2.283.3
    * grafana: 7.5.10 -> 7.5.11, fix CVE-2021-39226
    * linux: 5.10.70 -> 5.10.71
    * matrix-synapse: 1.43.0 -> 1.44.0
    * nodejs-12_x: 12.22.6 -> 12.22.7
    * nodejs-16_x: 16.10.0 -> 16.11.0
    * nodejs: 14.17.6 -> 14.18.1

* Jitsi: update jitsi-videobridge, jicofo and jitsi-meet to latest stable versions (#PL-130164).
* Ensure proper order of startup and shutdown for services that are likely to
  access NFS shares. This affects mainly LAMP stacks and nginx from a platform
  perspective. Customer applications should adapt their own service units - when
  relying on NFS - as well (#PL-129954).
* Add routes for all known subnets to all interfaces.
  This avoids problems with traffic using the wrong interface after we disabled
  policy routing (#PL-130130).

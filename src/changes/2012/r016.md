# Release 2012-06-09

## Packages

- Install statically linked {command}`sash` shell to easy recovery from dynamic
  linking problems.

## Configuration

- Monitor iSCSI target daemons more tightly and recover automatically from
  crashes (#10933).
- Fix bug in resolver config which leads to nameserver lookup timeouts when the
  primary nameserver is not responding (#10949).
- Fix resource sizing bug in PostgreSQL configuration which caused PostgreSQL to
  allocate more shared memory than totally available on some machines (#10951).
  PostgreSQL restart is necessary in most cases.

## Monitoring

- Improve network routing for monitoring server to avoid false alerts due to
  connectivity problems.

## Documentation

- Publish documentation updates also via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/gocept).

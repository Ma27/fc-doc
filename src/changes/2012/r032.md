# Release 2012-10-17

## Packages

- Drop support for PostgreSQL 8.2 since does not receive upstream support
  anymore and has open security issues (RT 85344).

## Configuration

- Move puppet master to a different machine. This should not lead to
  user-visible changes.
- Stop awstats support for shared hosting customers. awstats will still be
  available for VM customers (#11363).
- awstats config files are now writable by service users and live in
  {file}`/etc/awstats/vhosts.d`.

## Monitoring

- Move monitoring server to different machine. Note that some DNS resolvers do
  not expire the old IP addresses.
- Change mail sender address for Nagios alerts to a machine-independent format.

## Documentation

- Update awstats section in {ref}`webgateway` role documentation.

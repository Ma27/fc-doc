# API

The Flying Circus provides an API that enables you to interact with our
platform in a programmatic way: creating, updating, and deleting resources
like virtual machines, service users, granting permissions, and retrieving
information about the usage of those resources platform.

:::{note}
The API is currently under development and only available to selected customers and projects at the moment. Please be careful: accidents may happen and cause downtime or data loss.

If you're interested in accessing the Flying Circus through an API, [let us know](mailto:support@flyingcircus.io)!
